Since 2015, members of the high-performance computing (HPC) research community, led by the [IDEAS Productivity project](https://ideas-productivity.org), have been organizing "birds of a feather" (BoF) sessions at the [Supercomputing](https://supercomputing.org/) and [ISC High Performance](https://www.isc-hpc.com/) conferences to provide opportunities for scientific software developers to get together, share experiences, and build the community.

While the exact title of the BoF has evolved, the format has remained consistent: a series of lightning talks from members of the community followed by a free-ranging discussion. This site provides archives of the BoF series, including agendas, copies of the presentations, and notes of the discussions.
