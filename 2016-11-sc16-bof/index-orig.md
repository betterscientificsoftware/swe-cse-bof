## Abstract

Software engineering (SWE) for computational science and engineering
(CSE) is challenging, with more sophisticated, higher fidelity
simulation of larger and more complex problems involving larger data
volumes, more domains, and more researchers. Targeting high-end
computers multiplies these challenges. We invest a great deal in
creating these codes, but we rarely talk about that
experience. Instead we focus on the results.

Our goal is to raise awareness of SWE for CSE on supercomputers as a
major challenge and to begin the development of an international
"community of practice" to continue these important discussions
outside of annual workshops and other "traditional" venues.

## Agenda


Time | Topic | Speaker
-----|-------|--------
3 min | [Introduction and Goals](000-intro-bernholdt.pdf) | David Bernholdt, Oak Ridge National Laboratory
10 min | [Formal Methods for HPC: Correct Dosage](002-formal-gopalakrishnan.pdf)<br>_Abstract: HPC software is characterized by its inclusion of domain mathematics, parallelism for scale, and longevity (when successful). Formal methods have an important role to play in helping avoid bugs, but the dosage depends on the scale of application (e.g. library functions or whole applications). We will briefly showcase two projects, one where a higher dosage was possible for tuning the precision of small floating-point routines, and another where large-scale data race checking of OpenMP programs relied more on good tool engineering._ | Ganesh Gopalakrisnhan, University of Utah
