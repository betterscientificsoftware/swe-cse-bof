description: |
  Software engineering (SWE) for computational science and engineering
  (CSE) is challenging, with more sophisticated, higher fidelity
  simulation of larger and more complex problems involving larger data
  volumes, more domains, and more researchers. Targeting high-end
  computers multiplies these challenges. We invest a great deal in
  creating these codes, but we rarely talk about that
  experience. Instead we focus on the results.

  Our goal is to raise awareness of SWE for CSE on supercomputers as a
  major challenge and to begin the development of an international
  "community of practice" to continue these important discussions
  outside of annual workshops and other "traditional" venues.
