description: |
  Software engineering (SWE) for modeling, simulation, and data analytics for computational science and engineering (CSE) is challenging, with ever-more sophisticated, higher fidelity simulation of ever-larger, more complex problems involving larger data volumes,more domains, and more researchers. Targeting both commodity and custom high-end computers multiplies these challenges. We invest significantly in creating these codes, but rarely talk about that experience; we just focus on the results.

  We seek to raise awareness of SWE for CSE on supercomputers as a major challenge, and develop an international "community of practice" to continue these important discussions outside of workshops and other "traditional" venues.
