description: |
  Software has become central to all aspects of modern science and technology. Especially in high-performance computing (HPC) and computational science and engineering (CSE), it is becoming ever-larger and more complex while computer platforms evolve and become more diverse. Simultaneously, the teams behind the software are becoming larger, more technically diverse, and more geographically distributed.

  This BoF provides an opportunity for people concerned about these topics to share existing experiences and activities, discuss how we can improve on them, and share the results. Presentations and discussion notes will be made available at the BoF series website, <http://bit.ly/swe-cse-bof>.

## BoF Goals

1. Hear about some interesting things of interest to scientific software developers (Lightning Talks)
2. Free-form discussion about the current "state of the practice" in our community
3. Identify people interested in contributing to a blog article for [BSSw.io](https://bssw.io) summarizing the BoF (like our [SC24](https://bssw.io/blog_posts/reflecting-on-our-community-the-sc24-bof-on-scientific-software-and-the-people-who-make-it-happen-building-communities-of-practice), [SC23](https://bssw.io/blog_posts/reflecting-on-our-community-the-sc23-bof-on-scientific-software-and-the-people-who-make-it-happen-building-communities-of-practice) and [SC21](https://bssw.io/blog_posts/reflecting-on-our-community-the-sc21-bof-on-software-engineering-and-reuse-in-modeling-simulation-and-data-analytics-for-science-and-engineering) blog posts).
4. Meet your colleagues and have fun!
