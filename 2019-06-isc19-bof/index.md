description: |
  Software engineering (SWE) for computational science and engineering
  (CSE) is challenging, with ever-more sophisticated and higher fidelity
  simulations of ever-larger and more complex problems involving larger
  data volumes, more domains, and more researchers. Targeting both
  commodity and custom high-end computers and the recent rise in
  accelerators multiplies these challenges. We invest a great deal in
  creating these codes, but rarely talk about that experience; we just
  focus on the results.

  Further, the digitalization of the whole scientific process increases
  the attention others may give to the CSE software we
  produce. Transparency and reproducibility of research puts software
  front and center, along with concerns about its quality and
  longevity. With software as an increasingly important output from
  scientific research, there are also concerns about how to give
  appropriate credit in publications and for professional advancement.

  Our goal is to raise awareness of SWE for CSE on supercomputers as a
  major challenge, and to develop an international “community of
  practice” to continue these important discussions outside of workshops
  and other “traditional” venues.

  This BoF provides an opportunity for people concerned about this topic
  to share existing activities, discuss how we can expand and improve on
  them, and share the results. Presentations and discussion notes will
  be made available to the community at the BoF series website,
