## Abstract

Software engineering (SWE) for computational science and engineering
(CSE) is challenging, with ever-more sophisticated and higher fidelity
simulations of ever-larger and more complex problems involving larger
data volumes, more domains, and more researchers. Targeting both
commodity and custom high-end computers and the recent rise in
accelerators multiplies these challenges. We invest a great deal in
creating these codes, but rarely talk about that experience; we just
focus on the results.

Further, the digitalization of the whole scientific process increases
the attention others may give to the CSE software we
produce. Transparency and reproducibility of research puts software
front and center, along with concerns about its quality and
longevity. With software as an increasingly important output from
scientific research, there are also concerns about how to give
appropriate credit in publications and for professional advancement.

Our goal is to raise awareness of SWE for CSE on supercomputers as a
major challenge, and to develop an international “community of
practice” to continue these important discussions outside of workshops
and other “traditional” venues.

This BoF provides an opportunity for people concerned about this topic
to share existing activities, discuss how we can expand and improve on
them, and share the results. Presentations and discussion notes will
be made available to the community at the BoF series website,
