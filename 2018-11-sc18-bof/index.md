description: |
  Software engineering (SWE) for computational science and engineering
  (CSE) is challenging, with ever-more sophisticated and higher fidelity
  simulation of ever-larger and more complex problems involving larger
  data volumes, more domains, and more researchers. Targeting both
  commodity and custom high-end computers multiplies these
  challenges. We invest a great deal in creating these codes, but rarely
  talk about that experience; we just focus on the results.

  Our goal is to raise awareness of SWE for CSE on supercomputers as a
  major challenge, and to develop an international "community of
  practice" to continue these important discussions outside of workshops
  and other "traditional" venues.
