## Abstract

Software engineering (SWE) for computational science and engineering
(CSE) is challenging, with ever-more sophisticated and higher fidelity
simulation of ever-larger and more complex problems involving larger
data volumes, more domains, and more researchers. Targeting both
commodity and custom high-end computers multiplies these
challenges. We invest a great deal in creating these codes, but rarely
talk about that experience; we just focus on the results.

Our goal is to raise awareness of SWE for CSE on supercomputers as a
major challenge, and to develop an international "community of
practice" to continue these important discussions outside of workshops
and other "traditional" venues.
