## Official joke 

Miranda: ‚ÄúWhy does a software engineer say it works on my machine?... It‚Äôs a regular expression‚Ä¶‚Äù üòõ

## Lightning Talk Q&A

### Question for Lippi - ‚ÄúHave you considered that you might use demos of people who are using your resources well or in a cool fashion to improve the engagement of new users?‚Äù

* They have a monthly meeting that is informational in some sense but some of the 10K users contribute topics and content for these meetings
* It would be interesting to have shorter calls or meetings that are more informal but still collaborative
* Tips and Tricks channel on their Slack - some users contribute things there as well

### Question for Lippi - ‚ÄúHow do you create safe spaces for users to ask ‚Äúsilly‚Äù questions?‚Äù

* We haven‚Äôt fully yet. There is Slack, and they have looked at Discourse (but not Discord) but haven‚Äôt found a good solution yet. 
* We (NERSC) are one of the first institutions that have a code of conduct for users, which does allow for 
* Dan: culture probably more important than technology.  Also consider seeding the space with some ‚Äúexamples‚Äù of reasonable online discussions
* Miranda notes - humor is a key part of this. There is an #rsememes channel that helps to create community and culture on the USRSE slack. 

### Question for Andrew - ‚ÄúHow would HPC Carpentries fit in with existing SW Carpentries projects?‚Äù

* It would be a peer of SW Carpentry

### Question for Phillipe - ‚ÄúWhat is your vision for the EIGREP group longer term in terms of community?‚Äù

* For ACM, it is about money
* Regular newsletter is a start
* How do we create and maintain community with the correct forums? Slack doesn‚Äôt seem like it would be a good resource for us. They have a mailing list.
* Phillipe asks - ‚Äúdo you have a good experience with Slack?‚Äù
    * Miranda notes that you may have to pay for it (can be expensive) to have the best experience.
    * NCAR experience: Slack fatigue from 10 different Slack workspaces with similar purposes, but different enough that they can't be combined.

### Question for Dan - ‚ÄúWhat‚Äôs the next collaboration between USRSE, IEEE Computer Society following the career guidebook?‚Äù

* From IEEE CS perspective: Other customized versions for different communities
* No particular plans from the US-RSE side
* Follow-up: ‚ÄúHow do we build on 
    * USRSE Outreach working group - how do we communicate to people in secondary school 
    * Education and training workgroup from USRSE should also consider questions
    * David B notes
        * People in the RSE pipeline drop out early in the process
        * Talk about what is computational science. Talk about how this advances science.
    * NSF may be interested to fund a group in this area; there may be resources available if people want to pursue it

### Question for Radovan - ‚ÄúHow do you plan to get support from your day job for the Research Software Hour?‚Äù

* Some support from work for 1-2 hours bi-weekly or monthly is probably not a large request
* Miranda follows up - how can we collaborate to do cool things?
    * Radovan notes - it‚Äôs important for us to advertise and share what we are working on it
    * Important to make it casual, so that people are not afraid to share unfinished/unpolished work
    * Ask developers to share their tools and tricks in the research software hour
    * Education and training working group does 


## General Discussion

### Sustainability of communities focused on best practices - how can we trigger that transformation from a small group of dedicated volunteers to a widespread effort

* Jamie did a lot of retweeting of related efforts which helped to improve the engagement; advertisement and recruiting are key!
* Alain notes that contributors to a tool are using the tool in their environment
* Radovan notes - trust people and promote them quickly to positions of leadership
* Neil Hong (Edinburgh) notes that there are multiple generations of contributors
    * 1st - leadership of initial effort
    * 2nd - rewarded and valued 
    * 3rd - doing it because it needs to be done not just because of the reward and value
        * need to pay community members at this point!
* Miranda - there are many introverts in our communities ("the silent majority"). How can we enable this group to do small things that don‚Äôt require being socially engaged?
    * Updating website, running the job board, taking notes/etc.

### What kinds of things might we want to build out into larger communities? How many people are engaged in...

* training activities for RSEng topics?
* organizing seminar/webinar series around scientific software topics?
* information about RSeng practices?

A fair number of people raised their hands for each of these. Can we build on things like this?  Share, work together, collect and advertise?

### Question about this BoF series: "What's the role of such one-time (annual) events in building the community?"

* Primarily a venue for people to get people together and talking
* No particular "product" promised (apart from notes and maybe blog article)
* Would be happy if people met at one of the BoFs and started doing something together (haven't tried to track this, though)
* Fellow organizers suggest interesting lightning speakers, many of whom David hasn't met before

### Where are you collecting resources that are useful for the community? 

* Many collect/publish for local group/institution
* Neil - publishing across multiple platforms, Zenodo, joint publishing with BSSw, work with CC-BY materials
* German project [Helmholtz Hirse](https://www.helmholtz-hirse.de/)
    * Various useful resources
    * Just added Research Software Hour!
* [BSSw.io](https://bssw.io)
    * "Curated content" -- pointers to useful resources hosted elsewhere
    * Blog series -- both volunteer and solicited articles, cross-posting welcome
    * Events
    * Contributions via pull requests (or just contact the editors)
* Project mentioned in Best practices in HPC education and training workshop to collect (not create or deliver) and share information about resources.

### Is there one good, introductory resource for new entrants to scientific computing?

* It would be nice to have a ‚Äúresource of resources‚Äù
* David notes that BSSw points to SSI guides and resources
* Maybe (national) RSE organizations could help collect these resources? 
    * Ian says that US-RSE does some of this but we need to make sure that links work and sites are up-to-date. Put in a pull request!
* Carpentries.org is a hierarchy that then leads to lesson incubator (contributors) 
* Helen says we need to find the right place for our audience.
* For example, Handshake ([https://joinhandshake.com/](https://joinhandshake.com/)) could be a place where we could get career path information for RSEs to students - available across all (US) universities
* Jamie asks a follow-up question - who uses these resources?
    * Seems to be self-selecting to those who curate resources. Do we need a search engine? 
    * Sometimes it‚Äôs unclear which resources we should use and where we should start!
    * Miranda mentions that when she finds new resources that are useful, this is when she typically adds it to such a list or shares it as a resource
