## Abstract

Software engineering (SWE) for modeling, simulation, and data analytics for computational science and engineering (CSE) is challenging, with ever-more sophisticated, higher fidelity simulation of ever-larger, more complex problems involving larger data volumes, more domains, and more researchers. Targeting both commodity and custom high-end computers multiplies these challenges. We invest significantly in creating these codes, but rarely talk about that experience; we just focus on the results.

We seek to raise awareness of SWE for CSE on supercomputers as a major challenge, and develop an international “community of practice” to continue these important discussions outside of workshops and other “traditional” venues.

## Discussion Notes

### Breakout Topics

* Rooms 01: Computational Science Ecosystems (Lightning Talk)
* Rooms 02: Open Source for Researchers (Lightning Talk)
* Rooms 03: Training Programs (Lightning Talk)
* Rooms 04: RSE Career Paths (Lightning Talk)
* Rooms 05: FAIR4RS (Lightning Talk)
* Rooms 06: Reproducibility (Lightning Talks)
* Rooms 07: DEI in CSE, HPC, and RSE
* Rooms 08: Applying Industry Best Practices to Research Software
* Rooms 09: Incentivizing Adoption of Best Practices
* Rooms 10: Maturity of Data Engineering (Compared to Software Engineering)

### Brief Instructions for Breakouts

* Choose a breakout room for a topic of interest
* Try to balance the number of people per room (< 10)
* Take notes in the Google Doc for your breakout room
* At the end, write a short summary for the public summary and blog post
* And a very brief "take-away" message for a one-minute report-back

After the BOF we'll publish the public summary here and as a blog article for [BSSw.io](https://bssw.io).
