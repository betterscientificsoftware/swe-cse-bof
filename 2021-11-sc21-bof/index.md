description: |
  Software engineering (SWE) for modeling, simulation, and data analytics for computational science and engineering (CSE) is challenging, with ever-more sophisticated, higher fidelity simulation of ever-larger, more complex problems involving larger data volumes, more domains, and more researchers. Targeting both commodity and custom high-end computers multiplies these challenges. We invest significantly in creating these codes, but rarely talk about that experience; we just focus on the results.

  We seek to raise awareness of SWE for CSE on supercomputers as a major challenge, and develop an international “community of practice” to continue these important discussions outside of workshops and other “traditional” venues.

## Discussion Notes

We've published a blog article on the Better Scientific Software resource site (<https://bssw.io>) based on this BoF: [Reflecting on Our Community: The SC21 BoF on Software Engineering and Reuse in Modeling, Simulation, and Data Analytics for Science and Engineering](https://bssw.io/blog_posts/reflecting-on-our-community-the-sc21-bof-on-software-engineering-and-reuse-in-modeling-simulation-and-data-analytics-for-science-and-engineering)

Alternatively, you can read the [summary notes from the discussion groups](bof-notes).
