description: |
  Software developers, researchers, trainers, and outreach staff will
  meet to raise awareness of the challenges and opportunities for
  developing and promoting software engineering practices, including the
  development of reusable software to enhance the computational science
  and engineering ecosystem for HPC systems to accelerate the "time to
  science".

  The BoF attendees will help develop an international "community of
  practice" to share experiences in developing quality software,
  gathering community feedback, addressing interoperability, and
  promoting software to applications developers and users.

  We will identify strategies for ongoing efforts to inform, engage, and
  benefit the community and thereby advance the HPC software ecosystem.
